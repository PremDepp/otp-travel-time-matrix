# otp-travel-time-matrix
This repository aims to provide a reproducible of how to build a travel time matrix using OpenTripPlanner.

As you might have noticed, the code is not working (yet). I've created this repo because I need you help to make it work :) and because it could be a useful reference for others in the future.



There is more information about how to automate Open Trip Planner (OTP) [here](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/Scripting/).

#### 3 Steps to buil a travel time matrix

##### Step 1: Download files to your folder

Most of the files you need are in the repository. The other files you can download here:

* [jython-standalone.jar](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-standalone/2.7.0/jython-standalone-2.7.0.jar)

* [otp-0.19.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar](http://dev.opentripplanner.org/jars/otp-0.19.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar)



##### Step 2: Build Graph.obj
Open your Command Prompt and run this line to set the directory where you've saved the files

`cd C:\Users\rafa\Desktop\otp-travel-time-matrix2`

Now run this line to build the Graph.obj

`java â€“Xmx10G -jar otp-0.19.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar --cache C:\Users\rafa\Desktop\otp-travel-time-matrix2 --basePath C:\Users\rafa\Desktop\otp-travel-time-matrix2 --build C:\Users\rafa\Desktop\otp-travel-time-matrix2\portland`


##### Step 3: Run the Python script

`c:\jython2.7.0\bin\jython.exe -Dpython.path=otp-0.19.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar test.py`


This code is based on the [@laurentg's code](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/blob/master/src/test/resources/scripts/test.py) but it tries to achieve a different output, providing a travel time matrix.
